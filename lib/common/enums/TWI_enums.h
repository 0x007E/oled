/**
 * @file TWI_enums.h
 * @brief Enumerations for TWI/I2C interface modes, operations, acknowledgment, and error codes.
 * 
 * This header file defines the enums used to represent various states and configurations related to software TWI (Two-Wire Interface, I2C) communication. It includes enumerations for device operation modes (master/slave), communication operation types (read/write), acknowledgment status (ACK/NACK), and error codes for handling communication results.
 * 
 * @note These enums improve code readability by providing meaningful symbolic names for TWI-related values, facilitating protocol-compliant and maintainable software design.
