 * @brief Macro definitions for TWI/I2C communication flags and operations.
 * 
 * This header file contains essential macros for handling TWI (Two-Wire Interface) communication.
 * 
 * @note These macros serve to improve code clarity and maintain protocol compliance by providing meaningful names
 * for standard TWI/I2C signal and operation indicators.
