/**
 * @brief Initialize the TWI (I2C) hardware interface.
 *
 * @param operation Specifies the mode of operation:
 *                  - 0x00 (TWI_Mater) for master mode (default)
 *                  - 0x01 (TWI_Slave) for slave mode
 *
 * @return Returns the current TWI status byte after initialization.
 *
 * @details
 * This function configures the `TWI` hardware registers to initialize the bus in either master or slave mode.
 * 
 * In master mode, it sets the bitrate and prescaler according to predefined macros.
 * 
 * In slave mode, it sets the slave address, enables general call reception if defined, configures the prescaler, and enables the `TWI` interface.
 * 
 * @note If TWI interrupt processing is enabled (`TWI_TWIE`), interrupts are activated and global interrupts are enabled.
 * 
 * The function returns the initial TWI status for further status checking after initialization.
